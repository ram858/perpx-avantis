# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Actual Minimum is UNKNOWN

## 🚨 The Problem

**You lost $20 yesterday** - This proves $20 is also below the minimum!

**Testing History:**
- ❌ $12.5 - Rejected
- ❌ $12.8 - Rejected  
- ❌ $12.95 - Rejected
- ❌ $14.0 - Rejected
- ❌ $14.5 - Rejected
- ❌ $14.9 - Rejected
- ❌ $14.99 - Rejected
- ❌ **$20.00 - Rejected (Lost yesterday)** ⚠️

**Current Safeguard**: $25.0 (but this is a GUESS - actual minimum is unknown)

## ⚠️ Critical Warning

**We DON'T KNOW the actual minimum!** It could be:
- $25 (our current safeguard)
- $30, $50, $100, or even higher
- Based on notional value (collateral × leverage)
- Varies by trading pair

## 🛡️ Current Protection

**Safeguard Updated:**
- ✅ Minimum set to **$25** (higher than rejected $20)
- ✅ Pre-validation blocks trades below $25
- ⚠️ **But $25 might also be rejected!**

## 🎯 Recommendation

**DO NOT TRADE** until you:

1. **Contact Avantis Support** - Ask for official minimum position size
2. **Check Avantis Documentation** - Look for minimum requirements
3. **Deposit $50+** - Test with higher amounts if you want to find minimum
4. **Or wait** - Until we can determine the actual minimum

## 📞 Contact Avantis Support

**Ask them:**
- What is the minimum position size for BTC/USD?
- Is minimum based on collateral or notional value?
- Does minimum vary by trading pair?
- Why are positions failing with BELOW_MIN_POS even with $20?

## 💡 Alternative Approach

**Instead of guessing**, we could:
1. Query the contract directly for minimum (if it exposes this)
2. Check Avantis documentation/whitepaper
3. Test with very high amounts ($100, $200) to find the actual minimum
4. Contact Avantis support for official answer

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**Current Risk: HIGH**
- We're guessing at the minimum
- $25 might also be rejected
- More funds could be lost if we test blindly

**Safer Approach:**
- Get official minimum from Avantis
- Or test with very high amounts ($100+) to ensure it works
- Or don't trade until we know for sure

---

**Status**: 🛡️ Safeguard at $25, but **actual minimum is UNKNOWN** - trading is risky until we know the real minimum!
